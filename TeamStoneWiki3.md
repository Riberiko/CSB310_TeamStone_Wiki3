# Team Stone Wiki 3 - Programming Languages Deep Dive C#

C# is an advanced, flexible, and influential programming language engineered by Microsoft. As an integral component of the .NET framework, it delivers a sturdy foundation for creating diverse applications across web, desktop, mobile, and gaming platforms. Within this Wiki, we will delve into several crucial topics that enrich your comprehension of C# and its vast capabilities.

### Data Types (Chapter 6)  - Chris
### Expressions (Chapter 7) - Chris
### Assignment Statements (Chapter 7) - Yen
### Statement-Level Control Structures (Chapter) - Michael
### Subprograms (Chapter 9 and 10) - Riko

A subprogram is a code block that contains a serires of statements.
A program causes the statements to be excecuted by calling the subprogram and specifing any sub program arguments. In C# every every excuted instruction is performed in the contenxt of that subprogram.

All C# programs begin in the Main method or sub program.
//What i had barly began talking about 

#### Method Signatures

//Blcok of code and that is ot 

#### Method Acess

//Block of code that is then to be running


#### Parametes vs Arguments

//Block of code that will berunning

#### Pass by ref vs Val

//Block of ccode that will be running

#### Return Values 

//This part will then be covering the return value

### Abstract Data Types and Encapsulation Concepts (if there are any) (Chapter 11) - Riko

#### Abstarct Data Types

#### Encapsolation

Encapsolation is defined as the wraping up of data under a singuar unit. This is the mechanism that binds together code and the data as well as minipulates it. It is much like a body guard it protects the data from unauthorized changes.
Usally the varables and or data that belong to a class in encapsolation can not be accesed and or manipulated from outside classes.
In C# this can be done by declaring variable as private. It is the foundational concept in Object Oriented Programing.
